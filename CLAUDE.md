# Claude Project Patterns & Guidelines

## Project Overview

This is a **comprehensive developer training curriculum** consisting of 10 research-backed, gamified courses designed to transform beginners into interview-ready professionals.

**Purpose:** Educational content creation and course requirement documentation
**Type:** Documentation repository
**Primary Language:** Markdown
**Target Audience:** Developers learning TypeScript, React, Git, Python, SQL, Testing, LeetCode, Command-Line tools

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Educational Content Standards
- **Clarity First:** Explanations must be clear, concise, and accessible
- **Practical Focus:** Emphasize real-world applications over theory
- **Interview-Ready:** Include interview questions and practical scenarios
- **Code Examples:** Always provide working code examples
- **Progressive Learning:** Build from fundamentals to advanced topics

### 2. Writing Style
- **Tone:** Professional but encouraging, motivational without being cheesy
- **Format:** GitHub-flavored Markdown
- **Structure:** Clear headings, bullet points, code blocks
- **Emojis:** Use sparingly for visual navigation (‚úÖ ‚ùå üéØ üìö etc.)
- **Length:** Comprehensive but scannable, use TOC for long documents

### 3. Code Standards
- Use modern syntax (ES6+, latest TypeScript, Python 3.9+)
- Include comments for complex logic
- Show both correct and incorrect examples
- Use meaningful variable names
- Include error handling where relevant

## Documentation Patterns

### Course Structure Template

All course documents should follow this structure:

```markdown
# [Course Name]
## [Tagline]

---

## Course Overview
- Target Audience
- Time Commitment
- Success Metrics

## What You'll Learn
- Core skills list

## Learning Path
### Module 1: [Name] (X hours)
**Level:** [Novice/Practitioner/Expert]

#### 1.1: [Topic]
**Essential Concepts:**
[Code examples with comments]

**Interview Questions (XP: X):**
1. Question 1
2. Question 2

### [Repeat for all modules]

## Gamification System
- XP & Levels
- Achievement Badges
- Progress Tracking

## Interview Preparation
- Common questions
- Mock interviews
- Practical assessments

## Resources
- Links to tools
- Practice platforms
- Community

## Certification
- Requirements
- Levels

## Conclusion
- Motivational closing
```

### Code Block Guidelines

**Always specify language:**
```javascript
// Good - language specified
const example = "code";
```

**Include comments for complex code:**
```typescript
// Bad: No explanation
const process = (data: unknown) => transform(validate(data));

// Good: Clear explanation
// Validate input data, transform it, and return result
// Throws ValidationError if data is invalid
const process = (data: unknown): ProcessedData => {
  const validated = validate(data);  // Step 1: Validate
  return transform(validated);        // Step 2: Transform
};
```

**Show both correct and incorrect:**
```python
# ‚ùå Bad: Mutable default argument
def add_item(item, items=[]):
    items.append(item)
    return items

# ‚úÖ Good: None default with initialization
def add_item(item, items=None):
    if items is None:
        items = []
    items.append(item)
    return items
```

## Research & Planning Pattern

When adding new content or courses:

### Step 1: Research
```
1. Search for current industry standards (2025)
2. Find common interview questions
3. Identify most valuable skills
4. Check job market requirements
5. Review successful learning paths
```

### Step 2: Plan
```
1. Outline module structure
2. Identify key concepts
3. Select code examples
4. Choose gamification elements
5. Design progression path
```

### Step 3: Execute
```
1. Write module by module
2. Include code examples
3. Add interview questions
4. Create XP/badge system
5. Review and refine
```

### Step 4: Validate
```
1. Check for clarity
2. Verify code examples work
3. Ensure progressive difficulty
4. Validate interview relevance
5. Proofread for errors
```

## Gamification Patterns

### XP System Rules
- **Easy content:** 50-100 XP
- **Medium content:** 100-200 XP
- **Hard content:** 200-400 XP
- **Projects:** 300-1000 XP
- **Badges:** 50 XP bonus

### Badge Naming Convention
- **Foundational:** [Skill] Master/Expert/Hero
- **Advanced:** [Skill] Architect/Wizard/Guru
- **Special:** Interview Ready, Production Hero, etc.

### Level Progression
- Clear milestones every 1,000-2,000 XP
- Meaningful titles that reflect skill level
- Progressive difficulty in unlockables
