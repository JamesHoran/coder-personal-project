## Documentation Patterns

### Course Structure Template

All course documents should follow this structure:

```markdown
# [Course Name]
## [Tagline]

---

## Course Overview
- Target Audience
- Time Commitment
- Success Metrics

## What You'll Learn
- Core skills list

## Learning Path
### Module 1: [Name] (X hours)
**Level:** [Novice/Practitioner/Expert]

#### 1.1: [Topic]
**Essential Concepts:**
[Code examples with comments]

**Interview Questions (XP: X):**
1. Question 1
2. Question 2

### [Repeat for all modules]

## Gamification System
- XP & Levels
- Achievement Badges
- Progress Tracking

## Interview Preparation
- Common questions
- Mock interviews
- Practical assessments

## Resources
- Links to tools
- Practice platforms
- Community

## Certification
- Requirements

## Conclusion
- Motivational closing
```

### Code Block Guidelines

**Always specify language:**
```javascript
// Good - language specified
const example = "code";
```

**Include comments for complex code:**
```typescript
// Bad: No explanation
const process = (data: unknown) => transform(validate(data));

// Good: Clear explanation
// Validate input data, transform it, and return result
// Throws ValidationError if data is invalid
const process = (data: unknown): ProcessedData => {
  const validated = validate(data);  // Step 1: Validate
  return transform(validated);        // Step 2: Transform
};
```

**Show both correct and incorrect:**
```python
# ‚ùå Bad: Mutable default argument
def add_item(item, items=[]):
    items.append(item)
    return items

# ‚úÖ Good: None default with initialization
def add_item(item, items=None):
    if items is None:
        items = []
    items.append(item)
    return items
```

## Critical-Auditor Agent Usage

### IMPORTANT: When to Use the Critical-Auditor

The **critical-auditor** agent is your truth-telling quality guardian. You MUST use it proactively in these situations:

**Automatic Triggers - Use the Task tool with `subagent_type: "critical-auditor"` when you see:**

| User Says | What They Mean | Action Required |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| "audit" | Run critical audit | ‚úÖ Invoke critical-auditor |
| "critically review" | Deep quality check | ‚úÖ Invoke critical-auditor |
| "is this production ready?" | Final verification | ‚úÖ Invoke critical-auditor |
| "what could go wrong?" | Risk assessment | ‚úÖ Invoke critical-auditor |
| "tell me the truth" | Honest evaluation | ‚úÖ Invoke critical-auditor |
| "review this like a detective" | Skeptical analysis | ‚úÖ Invoke critical-auditor |
| "what security issues exist?" | Security audit | ‚úÖ Invoke critical-auditor |

**Proactive Usage - Use WITHOUT being asked when:**

1. **Before finalizing major course content** - Ensure educational quality meets standards
2. **After another agent completes work** - Verify claims and check for missed issues
3. **Before production deployment** - Final safety check
4. **When implementing feedback loops** - Round 1 audit ‚Üí fixes ‚Üí Round 2 audit ‚Üí Round 3 final
5. **After significant refactoring** - Ensure quality didn't degrade

### Critical-Auditor Invocation Pattern

**Correct way to invoke:**
```
Use the Task tool with these parameters:
- subagent_type: "critical-auditor"
- description: "Audit [specific thing]"
- prompt: "[Detailed prompt explaining what to audit and what to focus on]"
```

**Example invocations:**
```
Task(
  subagent_type="critical-auditor",
  description="Audit React course quality",
  prompt="Perform a critical audit of the React course at REACT_COURSE_REQUIREMENTS.md.
         Focus on: 1) Code example accuracy, 2) Interview question relevance,
         3) Modern React patterns (2025), 4) Missing error handling patterns.
         Provide specific line numbers for all issues found."
)
```

### The 3-Round Feedback Loop Pattern

When quality is critical, use this proven pattern:

**Round 1: Initial Critical Audit**
1. Invoke critical-auditor to identify ALL issues
2. Create PRPs (Product Requirements Prompts) from findings
3. Group issues by priority: CRITICAL ‚Üí HIGH ‚Üí MEDIUM ‚Üí LOW

**Round 2: Verification Audit**
1. Fix Priority 1 issues
2. Invoke critical-auditor again to verify fixes
3. Identify remaining issues and regression problems

**Round 3: Final Production Audit**
1. Fix all remaining issues
2. Final critical-auditor audit for production readiness
3. Get "SHIP IT" verdict or iterate further

**Success metrics from React course example:**
- Quality improved from 3.5/10 ‚Üí 10/10
- Time investment: 28.5 hours vs 40-60 hours without feedback loop
- Success probability: 99% vs 40% without systematic auditing

### What the Critical-Auditor Checks

**Code Quality:**
- Anti-patterns (index keys, missing cleanup, memory leaks)
- Security vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection, auth issues)
- Performance killers (N+1 queries, blocking operations)
- Type safety issues (improper `any` usage, missing error handling)
- Maintainability concerns

**Educational Content:**
- Accuracy of code examples (do they actually work?)
- Modern best practices (2025 standards)
- Interview question relevance
- Missing critical concepts
- Outdated or deprecated patterns

**Architecture & Design:**
- Scalability concerns
- Technical debt
- Over-engineering
- Coupling issues
- Missing abstractions

**Documentation:**
- Accuracy vs reality
- Completeness
- Outdated information
- False claims
- Missing warnings

### Agent Output Location

Critical-auditor generates reports saved to:
- `/audits/` directory
- Naming pattern: `[TOPIC]_CRITICAL_AUDIT_ROUND_[N].md`
- Each report includes: Executive Summary, Critical Issues, High Priority Issues, Overall Assessment

### Red Flags That Require Critical-Auditor

**Immediate audit required when you see:**
- ‚ùå Claims of "production ready" without error handling
- ‚ùå "It's fully tested" without actual test coverage verification
- ‚ùå Code examples teaching anti-patterns
- ‚ùå Security considerations marked "TODO"
- ‚ùå Performance claims without benchmarks
- ‚ùå Another agent claims "fixed" without verification
- ‚ùå Unbounded recursion or memory leaks
- ‚ùå Missing type safety
- ‚ùå Outdated dependencies with known vulnerabilities

### Critical-Auditor Communication Style

The agent is configured to be:
- **Direct and honest** - No sugar-coating
- **Evidence-based** - Backs up claims with file paths and line numbers
- **Skeptical** - Questions all claims, even from other agents
- **Risk-focused** - Identifies what WILL break, not what "might be concerning"
- **Actionable** - Provides concrete fixes, not vague suggestions

**Example output format:**
```markdown
üö® **CRITICAL: Index Key Anti-Pattern** - Severity: CRITICAL
- **Location**: src/lessons/1.2.tsx:45
- **Problem**: Using array index as React key in TodoList example
- **Evidence**: `{todos.map((todo, i) => <Todo key={i} />)}`
- **Impact**: Will cause state bugs when users reorder todos
- **Fix**: Use unique ID: `<Todo key={todo.id} />`
```

### Documentation References

For complete details, see:
- **Agent definition**: `.claude/agents/critical-auditor.md`
- **Comprehensive guide**: `docs/AGENT_FEEDBACK_LOOP_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- **Enhancement summary**: `docs/implementation-reports/CRITICAL_AUDITOR_ADDITION.md`
- **Example audits**: `audits/REACT_COURSE_CRITICAL_AUDIT_ROUND_[1-3].md`

### Summary: Your Responsibility

**You MUST proactively use the critical-auditor when:**
1. User says any variation of "audit", "review critically", or "is this ready?"
2. Before finalizing any major course content or code
3. After other agents complete work (verify their claims)
4. When quality and accuracy are mission-critical

**Remember:** The critical-auditor prevents production disasters and maintains the highest quality standards. Use it liberally. Trust, but verify. Then verify again.

---

**Remember:** This curriculum is designed to change lives. Every improvement makes a difference. Every clear explanation helps someone succeed. Every accurate code example prevents frustration.

**Your role:** Maintain the highest quality standards, keep content current, ensure clarity, and help learners succeed.

**When in doubt:** Research, verify, test, and always prioritize the learner's success.
