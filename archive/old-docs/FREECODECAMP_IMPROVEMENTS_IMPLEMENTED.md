      <h3>{title}</h3>
      <p>Price: ${price}</p>
      <p>In Stock: {inStock ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

// Usage: <ProductCard title="Laptop" price={999} inStock={true} />
```

**After (Fun!):**
```jsx
function PokemonCard({ name, power, legendary }) {
  return (
    <div className="pokemon-card">
      <h3>{name}</h3>
      <p>Power Level: {power}</p>
      <p>Legendary: {legendary ? '⭐ Yes!' : 'No'}</p>
