## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Find All Failed Submissions for a Lesson

```bash
GET /api/admin/submissions?lessonId=react-basics-01&passed=false
```

This returns all submissions where students failed the lesson, allowing you to identify common mistakes.

### Example 2: Track a Student's Progress

```bash
GET /api/lessons/submit?userId=user-123&lessonId=react-basics-01&stepId=react-basics-01-step-1
```

This shows all attempts a specific student made on a lesson, including their code evolution.

### Example 3: Analyze Lesson Difficulty

```bash
POST /api/admin/submissions/stats
{
  "lessonId": "react-basics-01"
}
```

This provides statistics showing pass rates and average attempts, helping you identify difficult lessons.

## Integration with Lesson Player

The `InteractiveLessonPlayer` component automatically submits answers when students run tests:

```typescript
// In InteractiveLessonPlayer.tsx
const handleRunTests = async () => {
  // Run tests
  const results = await runTests(userCode, testCases, stepId);

  // Submit to backend (automatic)
  await fetch('/api/lessons/submit', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      userId,
      lessonId: lesson.id,
      stepId: currentStep.id,
      code: userCode,
      passed: results.passed,
      testResults: results,
      xpEarned,
      language: currentStep.language,
    }),
  });
};
```

**No action required from students** - submissions are tracked automatically when they click "Run Tests".

## Common Queries

### 1. Find Solutions That Passed on First Try

```sql
SELECT * FROM LessonSubmission
WHERE passed = true AND attempts = 1;
```

### 2. Find Most Difficult Lessons

```sql
SELECT lessonId, AVG(attempts) as avg_attempts,
       COUNT(*) as total_submissions,
       SUM(CASE WHEN passed = true THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as pass_rate
FROM LessonSubmission
GROUP BY lessonId
ORDER BY avg_attempts DESC;
```

### 3. Find Common Mistakes

```sql
SELECT code, COUNT(*) as frequency
FROM LessonSubmission
WHERE lessonId = 'react-basics-01' AND passed = false
GROUP BY code
ORDER BY frequency DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

---

## Migration

### Run Database Migration

```bash
# Generate Prisma client with new model
npx prisma generate

# Create migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_lesson_submissions

# Apply migration to database
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

---

## Testing

### Test Submission Endpoint

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/lessons/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userId": "test-user",
    "lessonId": "react-basics-01",
    "stepId": "react-basics-01-step-1",
    "code": "function Greeting() { return <h1>Hello!</h1>; }",
    "passed": true,
    "xpEarned": 50,
    "language": "jsx"
  }'
```

### Test Retrieval Endpoint

```bash

---

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Student endpoints: Only access own submissions
- Admin endpoints: Require admin authentication
- Code submissions: Sanitized before storage
- Test results: Validated before storage

### SQL Injection Prevention
- Using Prisma ORM (parameterized queries)
- Input validation on all endpoints
- TypeScript type checking

### Data Sanitization
- HTML/script tags removed from code
- JSON validated before parsing
- Maximum code length enforced

---

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Anonymous Mode** - Allow practice without tracking
2. **Comparison View** - Compare student solution with correct solution
3. **Plagiarism Detection** - Identify copied solutions
4. **AI Analysis** - Auto-detect common mistake patterns
5. **Student Dashboard** - Let students view their own history
6. **Collaboration** - See how peers solved the problem
7. **Hints Based on Mistakes** - Suggest hints based on common errors

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Submissions Not Saving

**Check:**
1. Database connection established?
2. User ID exists in database?
3. API endpoint receiving requests?
4. Check browser console for errors

**Debug:**
```bash
# Check API logs
tail -f logs/api.log

# Test database connection
npx prisma studio
```

### Issue: Admin Page Not Loading

**Check:**
1. Prisma client generated? `npx prisma generate`
2. Migration applied? `npx prisma migrate deploy`
3. Admin route accessible?

### Issue: Duplicate Submissions

**Explanation:** This is expected behavior. Each "Run Tests" click creates a new submission, even for the same code. The `attempts` field tracks this.
