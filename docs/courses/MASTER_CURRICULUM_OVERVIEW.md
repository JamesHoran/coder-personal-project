## The Four Pillars

### 1. TypeScript Mastery
**[Full Course Details](TYPESCRIPT_COURSE_REQUIREMENTS.md)**

**Duration:** 60-80 hours
**Level Progression:** TypeScript Explorer → Type Craftsman → TypeScript Architect → TypeScript Master

**What You'll Master:**
- Complete TypeScript type system
- Advanced type manipulation and utility types
- Generic programming patterns
- Enterprise TypeScript patterns
- React with TypeScript
- Production deployment and optimization

**Key Projects:**
- E-Commerce Product Catalog
- Generic Data Structure Library
- Type-Safe Form Library
- Full-Stack E-Commerce Platform
- Microservices Architecture

**Why This Matters:**
TypeScript is no longer optional—it's the standard for modern JavaScript development. Companies using TypeScript report 15% fewer bugs and 15-25% salary premiums for TypeScript developers. Master this and you'll stand out in any interview.

---

### 2. Git & Version Control Mastery
**[Full Course Details](GIT_COURSE_REQUIREMENTS.md)**

**Duration:** 30-40 hours
**Level Progression:** Version Control Novice → Team Collaborator → Git Expert → Git Guru

**What You'll Master:**
- Complete Git command mastery
- Team collaboration workflows
- Branching strategies (GitFlow, GitHub Flow, Trunk-Based)
- Conflict resolution expertise
- Git internals and optimization
- CI/CD integration

**Key Projects:**
- Open Source Contribution Marathon
- Team Workflow Implementation
- Git Tool Development
- Repository Rescue Project

**Why This Matters:**
Git is the universal language of developer collaboration. 100% of professional development teams use version control, and your ability to navigate complex Git scenarios often determines your value to a team. This is your entry ticket to any serious development role.

---

### 3. React Excellence
**[Full Course Details](REACT_COURSE_REQUIREMENTS.md)**

**Duration:** 70-90 hours
**Level Progression:** React Apprentice → React Developer → React Expert → React Master

**What You'll Master:**
- Modern React with hooks
- Advanced component patterns
- Performance optimization
- State management at scale (Redux, Zustand, Context)
- React with TypeScript
- Testing React applications
- Next.js and full-stack React

**Key Projects:**
- Component Library
- E-Commerce Shopping Cart
- Social Media Feed
- High-Performance Data Table
- Full-Stack Social Media Platform
- Next.js SaaS Application

**Why This Matters:**
React powers the UIs of Facebook, Netflix, Airbnb, and thousands of other companies. React developers are in the highest demand, with median salaries 20-30% above baseline. Master React, and you unlock frontend, full-stack, and even mobile development (React Native) opportunities.

---

### 4. Asynchronous Programming Mastery
**[Full Course Details](ASYNC_PROGRAMMING_COURSE_REQUIREMENTS.md)**

**Duration:** 25-35 hours
**Level Progression:** Async Novice → Async Developer → Async Expert → Async Guru

**What You'll Master:**
- Event loop and JavaScript runtime
- Callbacks, Promises, Async/Await
- Concurrent and parallel execution
- Error handling and recovery patterns
- Async generators and iterators
- Real-time programming
- Performance optimization

**Key Projects:**
- HTTP Request Manager
- Concurrent Download Manager
- Resilient HTTP Client
- Real-Time Chat Application
- Task Queue System
- High-Performance API Gateway

**Why This Matters:**
Asynchronous programming is the foundation of modern JavaScript. Every API call, every database query, every user interaction involves async code. This is where most bugs occur and where performance is won or lost. Master async, and you'll be the developer everyone trusts with critical features.
