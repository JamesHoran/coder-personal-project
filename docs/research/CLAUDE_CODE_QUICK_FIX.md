# Claude Code Edit Permissions - Quick Fix Guide

## The Problem
User set `"defaultMode": "acceptEdits"` in `.claude/settings.local.json` but still sees permission prompts.

## Why It's Happening

`acceptEdits` mode ONLY applies to file operations:
- Read, Write, Edit operations
- Does NOT apply to Bash commands
- Does NOT apply to WebSearch or other tools

If you're seeing prompts for Bash commands, `acceptEdits` won't help.

## The Solution

### Quick Fix (Recommended)

Add this single line to your allow list in `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "defaultMode": "acceptEdits",
    "allow": [
      // ... existing rules ...
      "Bash(*)"  // ADD THIS LINE - allows all bash commands
    ],
    "deny": [
      "Bash(rm -rf /)",
      "Bash(rm -rf /*)",
      "Bash(shutdown:*)",
      "Bash(reboot:*)",
      "Bash(halt:*)",
      "Bash(poweroff:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Alternative Fix (Maximum Permissiveness)

Replace `defaultMode` with `bypassPermissions`:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "defaultMode": "bypassPermissions",
    "deny": [
      "Bash(rm -rf /)",
      "Bash(rm -rf /*)",
      "Bash(shutdown:*)",
      "Bash(reboot:*)",
      "Bash(halt:*)",
      "Bash(poweroff:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Key Points

1. **Permission Modes**: There are 4 modes:
   - `acceptEdits` - Auto-allows file edits only
   - `bypassPermissions` - Auto-allows everything except denied operations
   - `default` - Asks about everything not explicitly allowed
   - `plan` - Shows preview before execution

2. **Resolution Order**:
   1. Check allow list → If matched, allow
   2. Check deny list → If matched, deny
   3. Check ask list → If matched, ask
   4. Apply defaultMode → If not matched by above

3. **Current Config Issue**:
   - Has 80+ specific Bash patterns in allow list
   - Missing catch-all `Bash(*)` pattern
   - Commands not matching specific patterns still prompt

4. **No Conflicts**:
   - Having `"Edit(//home/coder/**)"` in allow list doesn't conflict with `acceptEdits`
   - They work together, not against each other
   - Explicit allow rules take precedence over defaultMode

## Files to Edit

**Location**: `/home/coder/coder-personal-project/.claude/settings.local.json`

**Change**: Add `"Bash(*)"` to the allow array (or change defaultMode to bypassPermissions)

**Restart**: After editing, restart Claude Code for changes to take effect

## Testing

After making the change:
1. Run a simple bash command
2. You should NOT see a permission prompt
3. Command should execute immediately

---

## TL;DR

Current config: `acceptEdits` + 80+ specific Bash patterns
Problem: Commands not in those 80+ patterns still prompt
Solution: Add `"Bash(*)"` to allow list
Result: Never prompted again (except for explicitly denied operations)
