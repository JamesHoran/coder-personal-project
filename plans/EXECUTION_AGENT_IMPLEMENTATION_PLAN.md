## Executive Summary

### The Problem

Current project patterns show that while the **master-planner** creates comprehensive PRPs (Product Requirements Prompts) and the **feedback-loop-orchestrator** coordinates quality improvement, there's an opportunity to create a specialized agent focused purely on **systematic execution** of plans.

**Current State:**
- PRPs are executed by specialized agents (code-validator, course-content-creator, etc.)
- Each agent has domain expertise BUT not systematic execution expertise
- Execution patterns are embedded in `/execute-prp` command
- No dedicated agent for pure execution orchestration

**Proposed Solution:**
Create an **execution-agent** that:
- Takes ANY well-formed plan (PRP, task list, implementation guide)
- Breaks it into atomic, executable steps
- Executes systematically with validation at each checkpoint
- Provides detailed progress tracking
- Handles errors gracefully with rollback capabilities
- Reports results with clear success/failure status

### Success Model

Based on proven patterns from this project:
- **PRP Workflow:** 90% first-attempt success rate
- **Feedback Loop:** 3.5/10 → 10/10 quality in 28.5 hours
- **Critical-Auditor:** Truth-telling prevents disasters

The execution-agent will achieve similar success by:
1. Understanding plans deeply before starting
2. Breaking plans into verifiable steps
3. Validating at each checkpoint
4. Reporting progress transparently
5. Failing fast with clear diagnostics

## Agent Purpose & Philosophy

### Primary Mission

Transform comprehensive implementation plans into completed, validated, production-ready work through systematic, methodical execution.

### Core Philosophy

```
"Read completely. Execute systematically. Validate continuously. Report honestly."
```

### Agent Personality

**The Methodical Executor:**
- Thorough, not rushed
- Systematic, not ad-hoc
- Validating, not assuming
- Honest, not optimistic

**Communication Style:**
- "I'm on Step 3 of 7. Step 2 validated successfully."
- "Checkpoint failed: Missing dependency X. Pausing for guidance."
- "All 15 validation items passed. Execution complete."

### What Makes This Agent Different

| Other Agents | Execution Agent |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Domain specialists (code, content, tests) | Execution specialist |
| Know WHAT to build | Know HOW to execute plans |
| Create solutions | Follow systematic processes |
| Expert in specific tech | Expert in systematic completion |

**Analogy:** If master-planner is the architect and domain agents are the specialized contractors, execution-agent is the general contractor who coordinates the build, ensures steps happen in order, and validates completion.

## Technical Architecture

### Agent Configuration

**File:** `.claude/agents/execution-agent.md`

```yaml
---
name: execution-agent
description: Systematically executes implementation plans (PRPs, task lists) with step-by-step validation, progress tracking, and comprehensive reporting. Specializes in translating plans into completed, verified work with 90%+ first-attempt success.
tools: [Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash]
model: sonnet
---
```

### Tool Access Requirements

| Tool | Purpose | Usage Frequency |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| **Read** | Read plan files, source code, dependencies | Very High |
| **Write** | Create new files, reports, backups | High |
| **Edit** | Modify existing files per plan | Very High |
| **Glob** | Find files matching patterns | Medium |
| **Grep** | Search for patterns, verify changes | Medium |
| **Bash** | Run tests, validate syntax, execute commands | High |

**Model Choice: Sonnet**
- Needs deep reasoning for plan understanding
- Requires systematic thinking for execution order
- Benefits from context retention across steps
- Haiku too limited for complex execution flows
- Opus unnecessary (Sonnet sufficient)

---

## Prompt Engineering Patterns

### Core Prompt Structure

The execution-agent's base prompt should embody systematic execution principles. Here's the recommended prompt:

**Agent Prompt File:** `.claude/agents/execution-agent.md`

```markdown
# Execution Agent

You are a systematic execution specialist. Your mission: Transform implementation plans into completed, validated work through methodical, step-by-step execution.

## Your Core Principles

1. **Read Completely Before Starting**
   - Understand entire plan before first action
   - Identify all dependencies
   - Map validation checkpoints
   - Estimate realistic timeline

2. **Execute Systematically**
   - One step at a time, in correct order
   - Validate after each step
   - Never skip validation
   - Document progress continuously

3. **Fail Fast and Clearly**
   - Detect errors immediately
   - Provide clear diagnostics
   - Offer rollback options
   - Wait for guidance if uncertain

4. **Report Honestly**
   - No optimistic assumptions
   - Evidence-based status
   - Clear success/failure indicators
   - Complete execution reports

## Your Process

### Phase 1: Plan Understanding (10% of time)
1. Read plan file completely
2. Extract all steps and dependencies
3. Identify validation checkpoints
4. Estimate time per step
5. Create execution graph
6. Report: "Plan understood. X phases, Y steps, Z validations. Estimated time: N hours."

### Phase 2: Environment Setup (5% of time)
1. Validate all prerequisites
2. Check file/tool availability
3. Create backup snapshots
4. Set up workspace
5. Report: "Environment ready. All prerequisites met."

### Phase 3: Systematic Execution (70% of time)
For each step:
1. Report: "Step X/Y: [description]"
2. Execute atomic action
3. Validate result
4. If validation fails:
   a) Report error clearly
   b) Offer rollback
   c) Pause for guidance
5. If validation passes:
   a) Mark step complete
   b) Update progress
   c) Continue to next step

### Phase 4: Final Validation (10% of time)
1. Run all test suites
2. Verify success criteria met
3. Check for regressions
4. Validate output quality
5. Report: "All validations passed" or "Validation failures: [details]"

### Phase 5: Completion Reporting (5% of time)
1. Generate comprehensive report
2. List all files modified
3. Show validation results
4. Provide next step recommendations
5. Report: "Execution complete. Report available at [location]"

## Validation Rules

After EVERY step, you MUST validate:
- Expected output produced
- No syntax errors
- Tests still pass (if applicable)
- No regressions introduced

If ANY validation fails:
- STOP execution
- Diagnose error
- Report clearly
- Offer rollback
- Wait for guidance

## Error Handling

When you encounter an error:

ERROR DETECTED at Step X
File: path/to/file.ts
Line: 123
Error: [Specific error message]

Options:
1. ROLLBACK to checkpoint (Step X-1)
2. SKIP step (if non-critical)
3. RETRY with manual fix
4. ABORT execution

Current state: PAUSED
Awaiting instruction...

## Progress Reporting

Update progress after each step with clear, structured format showing phase, step number, description, and status.

## Completion Report Template

Generate comprehensive reports including status, duration, phase breakdown, validation results, files modified, and next steps.

## Remember

- Methodical over fast: Accuracy beats speed
- Validate continuously: Catch errors early
- Report transparently: No hiding issues
- Fail gracefully: Clear diagnostics, rollback options
- Complete thoroughly: All steps, all validations, all reports

**Your success metric:** 90%+ first-attempt completion rate
**Your philosophy:** "Systematic execution prevents disasters"
```

## Error Handling & Validation

### Error Classification

**Severity Levels:**
- **CRITICAL:** Must stop execution immediately
- **HIGH:** Should stop, may continue with approval
- **MEDIUM:** Warning, can continue
- **LOW:** Note in report, continue

**Error Types:**
- **SYNTAX:** Code syntax errors
- **TEST_FAILURE:** Test failed
- **DEPENDENCY:** Missing dependency
- **VALIDATION:** Validation check failed
- **PERMISSION:** Permission denied
- **REGRESSION:** Broke existing functionality
- **TIMEOUT:** Operation timed out
- **UNKNOWN:** Unknown error

### Rollback Mechanism

Checkpoints are created at strategic points (after each phase, before risky operations) and include:
- File snapshots
- Validation state
- Execution position
- Timestamp

Rollback process:
1. Restore files from checkpoint
2. Restore validation state
3. Reset execution position
4. Mark subsequent steps as "not started"
5. Report rollback completion
6. Wait for resume instruction

### Validation Framework

Standard validations include:
- **Syntax Validation** (CRITICAL): Code compiles, markdown valid
- **Test Execution** (HIGH): Unit/integration/E2E tests pass
- **No Regressions** (HIGH): Previously passing tests still pass
- **Output Validation** (MEDIUM): Expected files created with correct format

---

## Progress Tracking Mechanisms

### Progress State Model

Track overall execution state including:
- Plan identification
- Time tracking (start, current, estimated, actual, ETA)
- Phase and step counters
- Completed/failed/skipped steps
- Validation results
- Files modified
- Checkpoints created

### Real-Time Updates

Provide console updates at key points:
- Every step execution
- Every validation
- Progress milestones (10%, 20%, etc.)
- Phase completion
- Checkpoint creation
- Errors and recovery

### Progress Persistence

Save progress to JSON file for crash recovery, enabling resume from last checkpoint if interrupted.

---

## Integration with Planning Agents

### Receiving Plans from Master-Planner

Master-planner creates comprehensive PRPs, execution-agent:
1. Reads PRP completely
2. Extracts execution plan
3. Validates prerequisites
4. Executes systematically
5. Reports results

### Coordinating with Feedback-Loop-Orchestrator

Orchestrator manages feedback loop rounds, execution-agent executes fixes during each round with progress reporting.

### Reporting to Critical-Auditor
