2. **Dependency Resolution:** Identify prerequisites and execution order
3. **Atomic Execution:** Execute one step at a time, validate before next
4. **Progress Tracking:** Maintain state across execution (checkpoints)
5. **Error Handling:** Detect failures, attempt fixes, escalate if needed
6. **Validation:** Run tests/checks at each phase completion
7. **Reporting:** Generate detailed execution reports with status
8. **Rollback:** Revert changes if validation fails

### Use Cases
1. Execute master-planner PRPs for React course fixes

### Prompt Engineering Strategy
```
You are the execution-agent. Your mission: execute implementation plans
systematically, phase by phase, with validation at every checkpoint.

Core behaviors:
- Parse PRP structure: phases → steps → validation

- Never skip validation: tests must pass before marking complete

Input format: PRP with phases, steps, code examples, validation criteria
Output format: Execution report with status, issues, results
```

### Implementation Complexity: High
**Why:** State management across long-running tasks, error recovery, validation orchestration

- 40% faster deployments
- 25% better database performance

**Educational Value:**
- Clearer explanations
- Modern, accurate examples
- Comprehensive learning resources

### Confidence Level

**High Confidence (P1 Agents):** 90%
- Clear value proposition
- Research-backed
- Well-defined scope
- Proven patterns

**Medium-High Confidence (P2 Agents):** 80%
- Good value proposition
- Some uncertainty in scope
- Requires domain expertise

**Medium Confidence (P3 Agents):** 70%
- Enhancement value
- Operational complexity
- May require iteration

### Final Recommendation

**Proceed with phased implementation:**
1. Build P1 agents (foundation)
2. Validate success metrics
3. Build P2 agents (high value)
4. Measure impact
5. Build P3 agents (enhancement)
6. Continuous improvement

**Success Criteria:**
- All P1 agents built and validated
- 90%+ success rate achieved
- Clear value demonstrated
- Decide on P2/P3 based on P1 results
